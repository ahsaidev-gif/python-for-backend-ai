# Python for Backend & AI Engineers

This repository contains **Python fundamentals** learned, practiced, and organized
from a **backend and AI engineering perspective**.

It forms the foundation for building real-world AI systems such as:

* LLM-based applications
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
* FastAPI-based backend services
* Data ingestion and preprocessing workflows

---

## What This Repository Contains

This repository documents **core Python concepts** with practical examples that are directly relevant to backend and AI engineering.

### Topics Covered

* Python basics and syntax
* Expressions and execution model
* Variables and primitive data types
* Strings and string operations
* Numbers, math operations, and type conversion
* Truthy and falsy values
* Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`, ternary expressions)
* Logical operators and comparisons
* Looping constructs:

* Python lists:
  * Mutability and references
  * Indexing and slicing
  * List operations and methods
  * List comprehensions
  * Using lists as stacks and queues
* Dictionaries:
  * Key–value mappings
  * Safe access using `get()`
  * Iteration using `items()`
  * Dictionary comprehensions
* Functions:
  * Defining reusable functions
  * Return values vs side effects
  * Positional, keyword, and default arguments
  * Variable arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`)
  * Positional-only and keyword-only parameters
* Lambda expressions
* Docstrings and function annotations
* File handling using `with`
* Control flow best practices
* Coding style and readability (PEP 8)
* Structural pattern matching using `match` (Python 3.10+)

All examples are written with **real backend use cases** in mind, not just academic syntax.

## Why This Repository?

I am a **backend software engineer transitioning into AI engineering**.

This repository represents the **first step in that journey** — building strong,
clean Python fundamentals that are essential for:

* Document ingestion and preprocessing
* Metadata extraction and transformation
* API request and response handling
* Validation and control-flow-heavy business logic
* AI system orchestration and glue code

Rather than focusing on shortcuts, this repo emphasizes **clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability**.

## How This Repository Is Used

The concepts and patterns learned here will be reused and extended in future projects involving:

* Pandas and NumPy for structured data processing
* OpenAI / Azure OpenAI API integration
* Embedding pipelines and vector databases
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
* Backend AI services built using FastAPI
* Production-grade AI workflows

This repository acts as a **reference base** for all future AI-related backend work.

## Learning Approach

* Concepts are learned incrementally
* Notes are written in plain, practical language
* Examples reflect real backend scenarios
* Emphasis on:

  * Readability
  * Predictable behavior
  * Safe defaults
  * API-friendly design

---

## Next Steps

Planned progression after this repository:

* Pandas for structured data handling
* NumPy fundamentals
* FastAPI for backend AI services
* OpenAI / Azure OpenAI API integration
* Building a production-style RAG application end-to-end
