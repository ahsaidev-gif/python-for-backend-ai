# Python for Backend & AI Engineers

This repository contains Python fundamentals learned and organized
from a **backend and AI engineering perspective**.

It forms the foundation for building real-world AI systems such as
LLM applications, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines,
and FastAPI-based backend services.

---

## Topics Covered

- Python basics and syntax
- Variables and primitive data types
- Strings and string operations
- Numbers and type conversion
- Conditional statements
- Loops and iterables
- Functions and arguments
- Basic file handling

---

## Why This Repository?

I am a backend software engineer transitioning into **AI engineering**.
This repository represents the **first step** in that journey —
strengthening Python fundamentals required for:

- Document ingestion and preprocessing
- Metadata handling
- API request and response processing
- AI system orchestration

---

## How This Repository Is Used

The concepts and examples in this repository will be reused in
future projects involving:

- Pandas-based data processing
- LLM API integration
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Backend AI services built with FastAPI

---

## Next Steps

- Pandas for structured data handling
- OpenAI / Azure OpenAI API integration
- Building a production-style RAG application
